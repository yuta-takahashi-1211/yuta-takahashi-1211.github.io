# Hello!

Starting this September, I will be joining the Institute of Social and Economic Research at Osaka University as an Associate Professor (without tenure).

My research interests lie in macroeconomics, with a focus on key challenges facing the Japanese economy, including debt, low growth, and demographic decline.

I also co-organize the [Seminar in Macroeconomics](https://sites.google.com/view/seminar-in-macroeconomics/) jointly run by the Institute of Economic Research (Hitotsubashi University) and the Kyoto Institute of Economic Research (Kyoto University).
