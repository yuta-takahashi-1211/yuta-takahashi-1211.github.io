# Hello!

Starting this September, I will be joining the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Osaka as an Associate Professor (without tenure).

My research interests lie in macroeconomics, with a focus on key challenges facing the Japanese economy, including debt, low growth, and demographic decline.

I also co-organize the [Seminar in Macroeconomics](https://sites.google.com/view/seminarinmacro/home) jointly run by the Institute of Economic Research at Hitotsubashi University and the Kyoto Institute of Economic Research at Kyoto University.
