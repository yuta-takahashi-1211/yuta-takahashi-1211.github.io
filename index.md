# Hello!

I am currently an Associate Professor (without tenure) at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, the University of Osaka.

My research interests lie in macroeconomics, with a focus on key challenges facing the Japanese economy, including debt, low growth, and demographic decline.

I also co-organize the [Seminar in Macroeconomics](https://sites.google.com/view/seminarinmacro/home) jointly run by the Institute of Economic Research at Hitotsubashi University and the Kyoto Institute of Economic Research at Kyoto University.
