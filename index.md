# Hello!

Iâ€™ll be starting as an Associate Professor (without tenure) at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, the University of Osaka, this September.

My interests include macroeconomics and most of my work focuses on the most important macro problems of the Japanese economy, including debt, low growth, and low fertility.

I also co-organize the [Seminar in Macroeconomics](https://sites.google.com/view/seminar-in-macroeconomics/) jointly run by the Institute of Economic Research (Hitotsubashi University) and the Kyoto Institute of Economic Research (Kyoto University).
