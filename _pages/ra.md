## Macroeconomics Research Assistants

Research assistants will be involved in data analysis and/or reviewing the literature. Applicants should be able to read and comprehend academic papers, be familiar with using AI tools, and have good communication skills in Japanese or English.

## Microeconomics Theory Reading Group

We are also recruiting students with a strong interest in microeconomic theory, particularly those focused on theoretical papers that could have significant implications for macroeconomics. If you have specific theoretical papers in mind that bridge microeconomics and macroeconomics, or if you are interested in exploring how microeconomic foundations inform macroeconomic phenomena, please contact us with your area of interest, relevant paper references, and a brief explanation of why these papers interest you.

## Undergraduate Research Projects: 
**Historical Data Digitization Project**

For undergraduate students interested in applied research support, we are offering a project focused on digitizing historical data from a range of published sources. The work provides practical experience in historical data collection and management, as well as basic data analysis and quality assurance. No prior technical skills are required.
